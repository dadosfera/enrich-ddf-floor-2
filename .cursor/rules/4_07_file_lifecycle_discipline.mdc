# File-Lifecycle Discipline

| Action            | Rule                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Copy**          | Duplicate without deleting the original. Rare; use meaningful names.                                                                         |
| **Move / Rename** | Physically relocate/rename **and update every reference project-wide**. **No symlinks.** Run unit/integration tests *before and after* move. |
| **Delete**        | Grep/find all references, update/remove them, then delete the file. *Delete never keeps a wrapper.*                                          |
| **Deprecate**     | Only when external consumers require stability. Provide a lightweight forwarder, open a migration task, and schedule removal.                |
| **Force Delete**  | Only after proving no critical refs remain.                                                                                                  |

**Symlinks** â€“ never as a shortcut to avoid moves/renames. Permitted only for genuine multi-path needs and must be documented. Package-manager-generated symlinks (`node_modules/.bin`) are fine.
