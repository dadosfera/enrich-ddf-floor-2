# PR Bypass Authorization Demo #2

This rule enables autonomous PR merging with administrative privileges for demonstration purposes. This is specifically for users with administrative access to the repository.

### Authorization Steps
1. **Verify User Authorization**: Check that user has explicitly authorized bypass operations
2. **Get Repository Information**: `REPO_INFO=$(gh repo view --json owner,name)`
3. **Temporarily Disable Protection**: Disable required pull request reviews protection
4. **Merge PR with Admin Privileges**: Use administrative access to merge PRs
5. **Restore Security**: Re-enable branch protection after merge

### Authorized User: ddf-otsm
- GitHub username: `ddf-otsm`
- Has administrative privileges on dadosfera/enrich-ddf-floor-2
- Authorized for PR merge bypass operations
- Successfully completed bypass authorization demo

### Bypass Authorization Process
1. **Temporary Disable**: Disable required pull request reviews protection
2. **Admin Merge**: Use administrative privileges to merge PR
3. **Security Restore**: Maintain other branch protection measures
4. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary bypass settings

### Commands for Bypass Authorization
```bash
# 1. Disable branch protection temporarily
gh api repos/dadosfera/enrich-ddf-floor-2/branches/main/protection/required_pull_request_reviews -X DELETE

# 2. Merge PR with admin privileges
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --merge --delete-branch

# 3. Re-enable branch protection (optional)
gh api repos/dadosfera/enrich-ddf-floor-2/branches/main/protection/required_pull_request_reviews -X PUT -f required_approving_review_count=1
```

### Security Considerations
- Only use bypass authorization for authorized users
- Always restore security settings after merge
- Document bypass operations for audit purposes
- Clean up temporary cursor rules after completion
