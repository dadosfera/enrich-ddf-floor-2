# ### 13  Minimize New Files

* Prefer extra flags over new scripts. Common flags include:
* `--turbo`: skip optional pre/post tasks for fastest run
* `--fast`: skip tests but still run core build/logic
* `--full`: full pipeline including lint, test, deploy, etc.
* `--tolerant`: suppress non-blocking warnings or missing dependencies during bootstrap
* `--verbose` / `--quiet`: control verbosity
* `--debug`: include debug output/logs

If splitting, orchestrate via a master script, document, ensure linting.
