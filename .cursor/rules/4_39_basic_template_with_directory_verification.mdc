```bash
# === ENHANCED SAFE COMMAND TEMPLATE ===
echo "=== Starting [OPERATION_NAME] ==="

# 1. Directory Context Verification
echo "📍 Directory Context:"
echo "  Current: $(pwd)"
echo "  Git root: $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo 'Not in git repo')"
echo "  Home: $HOME"

# 2. Pre-execution validation
if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    echo "❌ Target directory does not exist: $TARGET_DIR"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Execute with safety measures
echo "🚀 Executing command..."
timeout [TIME] [COMMAND] [SAFE_FLAGS] 2>&1 | head -[LIMIT]

# 4. Result reporting
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ [OPERATION_NAME] completed successfully"
