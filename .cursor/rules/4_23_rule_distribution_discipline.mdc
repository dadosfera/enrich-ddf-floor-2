# Rule Distribution Discipline for Cursor Platform

## Priority
P1 (Critical): Must always be followed

## Scope
Applies to all rule management operations in Cursor platform context

## Core Principle
**NEVER edit rules directly in platform-specific directories**

## Prohibited Directories
- `.clinerules/` - Cline platform rules
- `.cursor/rules/` - Cursor platform rules
- `rules/dadosfera/` - Dadosfera platform rules
- `rules/cline/` - Generated Cline rules
- `rules/cursor/` - Generated Cursor rules

## Authorized Workflow

### Step 1: Edit Canonical Sources
**Allowed Locations**:
- `pre-prompts/` - Canonical markdown rule definitions
- `rules/json/` - JSON rule specifications
- `schemas/` - Rule schemas and validation

### Step 2: Use Distribution Scripts
**Required Commands**:
- `scripts/extract_from_source.sh` - Extract and distribute rules
- `scripts/generate_complete_clinerules.sh` - Generate Cline rules
- `scripts/optimize_cursor_rules.sh` - Generate Cursor rules

### Step 3: Validate Distribution
**Validation Commands**:
- `tests/test_workflow_integrity.sh` - Test workflow consistency
- `tests/validate_cross_platform_consistency.sh` - Validate platform sync

## Emergency Override
**Authorization Required**: Explicit user permission with justification
**Documentation**: Must log override reason and restoration plan

## Enforcement Mechanisms
- Pre-commit hooks prevent direct edits to prohibited directories
- CI/CD validation checks rule distribution discipline
- Automated logging of all rule modification attempts
