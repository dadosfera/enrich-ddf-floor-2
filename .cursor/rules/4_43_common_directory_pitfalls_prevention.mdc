# ### Common Directory Pitfalls Prevention
- **Never assume**: Don't assume current directory is project root
- **Always validate**: Check directory existence before operations
- **Multiple fallbacks**: Use several methods for directory detection
- **Clear error messages**: Provide specific error information
- **Log everything**: Record all directory detection attempts

## Exceptions and Flexibility
- Some long-running processes may require special handling
- Always consult project-specific guidelines
- When in doubt, break commands into smaller, more manageable steps
