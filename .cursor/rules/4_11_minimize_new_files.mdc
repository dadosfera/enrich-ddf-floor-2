# Minimize New Files

- Prefer extra flags over new scripts. Common flags include:
- `--turbo`: skip optional pre/post tasks for fastest run
- `--fast`: skip tests but still run core build/logic
- `--full`: full pipeline including lint, test, deploy, etc.
- `--tolerant`: suppress non-blocking warnings or missing dependencies during bootstrap
- `--verbose` / `--quiet`: control verbosity
- `--debug`: include debug output/logs

If splitting, orchestrate via a master script, document, ensure linting.
