# Active Plans Completion Protocol

## 🎯 Definition of "Finished"
An active plan is **finished** when:
- ✅ All **core deliverables** are implemented
- ✅ **Critical functionality** is working
- ✅ **Documentation** is updated
- ✅ Plan is moved to `docs/plans/completed/`
- ✅ **Git state** is clean

## 📋 Completion Checklist
Before marking a plan as complete:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] **Primary functionality** implemented and tested
- [ ] **Critical endpoints** responding correctly
- [ ] **Database operations** working
- [ ] **Error handling** in place

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance
- [ ] **70%+ test coverage** for critical paths
- [ ] **No blocking linter errors** (accept minor issues)
- [ ] **Documentation updated** with current status
- [ ] **Migration scripts** created if needed

### Phase 3: Finalization
- [ ] **Plan moved** to completed directory
- [ ] **Progress documented** in commit message
- [ ] **Remaining work** noted for future
- [ ] **Success criteria** met

## 🚫 What NOT to Chase
- **100% test coverage** (aim for 70%+)
- **Perfect linter compliance** (accept minor issues)
- **All edge cases** (focus on core functionality)
- **Production-ready security** (document for future)

## 📊 Success Metrics
A plan is successfully completed when:
- **Core functionality works** (app starts, endpoints respond)
- **Critical tests pass** (health, basic CRUD)
- **Documentation reflects** current state
- **No blocking issues** remain

## 🔄 When Plans Are "Active"
A plan remains active if:
- **Core functionality** is not implemented
- **Critical tests** are failing
- **Documentation** is outdated
- **Blocking issues** prevent progress

## 📝 Documentation Standards
When completing a plan:
1. **Add completion summary** to plan file
2. **Document remaining work** for future
3. **Update related documentation**
4. **Create migration notes** if needed

## 🎯 Quick Assessment
To determine if a plan is complete:
1. **Can the app start?** ✅
2. **Do critical endpoints work?** ✅
3. **Do basic tests pass?** ✅
4. **Is documentation current?** ✅
5. **Are changes committed?** ✅

If 4/5 are ✅, the plan is **COMPLETE**.
