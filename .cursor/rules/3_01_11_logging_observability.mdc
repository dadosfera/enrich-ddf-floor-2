# ### 11  Logging & Observability

* **File Logs** – structured JSON `{ts,level,msg,script}`; rotate daily or at 10 MB.
* **Console Logs** – stdout/stderr for CLI & CI.
* **UI Logs** – human‑readable messages in web/GUI.
* Prefer structured‑log export if platform supports.
* Capture dry‑run output in file logs.
* **Network/API calls** – retry up to **3** times with exponential back‑off; log each attempt and final status.
* **Token budget** – internal dev chats may use the maximum available context, *but* user‑facing responses should remain concise (≈ ≤ 400 tokens) and well‑structured unless the user explicitly asks for exhaustive detail. Provide log links or summaries instead of dumping huge text blocks.
* Verify all three streams before asking user help; include excerpts.
