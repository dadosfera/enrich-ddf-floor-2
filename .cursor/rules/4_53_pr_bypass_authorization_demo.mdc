# PR Bypass Authorization Demo

This rule enables autonomous PR merging with administrative privileges for demonstration purposes. This is specifically for users with administrative access to the repository.

### Authorization Steps
1. **Verify User Authorization**: Check that user has explicitly authorized bypass operations
2. **Get Repository Information**: `REPO_INFO=$(gh repo view --json owner,name)`
3. **Temporarily Disable Protection**: Disable required pull request reviews protection
4. **Merge PR with Admin Privileges**: Use administrative access to merge PRs
5. **Restore Security**: Re-enable branch protection after merge

### Critical Warnings
- **CRITICAL**: Only users with explicit administrative privileges can bypass branch protection
- **Requirement**: User must have organizational approval for bypass operations
- **Verification**: Ensure user has necessary permissions before attempting bypass
- **Security**: Unauthorized bypass attempts will fail and may trigger alerts

### Usage in Cursor Rules
This rule activates when:
1. User explicitly authorizes bypass operations
2. `USER_AUTHORIZATION_BYPASS_BRANCH_PROTECTION=true` is set
3. User has administrative privileges on the repository
4. PR merge operations are required

### Authorized User: ddf-otsm
- GitHub username: `ddf-otsm`
- Has administrative privileges on dadosfera/enrich-ddf-floor-2
- Authorized for PR merge bypass operations
- Successfully completed bypass authorization demo

The AI can then autonomously:
- Temporarily disable branch protection
- Merge PRs using administrative privileges
- Restore branch protection settings
- Clean up branches after merge
