# ### 1  Preserve All Functionality

* Never remove or weaken existing features, logs, classes, functions, shell commands, or behavior.
* Refactor only when it delivers **0 feature loss** and 100 % parity or improvement.
* Replacement code must replicate and enhance the old one while keeping backward compatibility.
