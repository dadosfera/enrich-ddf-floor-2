# Logging & Observability

- **File Logs** – structured JSON `{ts,level,msg,script}`; rotate daily or at 10 MB.
- **Console Logs** – stdout/stderr for CLI & CI.
- **UI Logs** – human-readable messages in web/GUI.
- Prefer structured-log export if platform supports.
- Capture dry-run output in file logs.
- **Network/API calls** – retry up to **3** times with exponential back-off; log each attempt and final status.
- **Token budget** – internal dev chats may use the maximum available context, *but* user-facing responses should remain concise (≈ ≤ 400 tokens) and well-structured unless the user explicitly asks for exhaustive detail. Provide log links or summaries instead of dumping huge text blocks.
- Verify all three streams before asking user help; include excerpts.
