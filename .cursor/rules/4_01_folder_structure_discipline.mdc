# Folder-Structure Discipline

- **Nothing new** goes in the project root (`./`).
- Follow `/_dev/docs/project_structure.md` (or propose one and stick to it).
- `config/` now stores **all environment & platform descriptors** (YAML/TOML/JSON). No separate `multi_env/` folder is used.
- `workflow_tasks/scripts/` â€“ `workflow_tasks` stores reusable tooling, while `scripts` contains project-specific logic.
- Update `_dev/docs/index.md` **and** append an entry to `logs/move.log` after every add or move.
