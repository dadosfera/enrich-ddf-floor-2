# ### 20.2 Restrictions on Editing Ignored Files
AI agents are strictly prohibited from editing or modifying any files listed in `.cursorignore` or `.dadosferaignore`. These files are protected to prevent unintended changes by automated processes.

*   **Read-Only Access**: AI agents are permitted to read the contents of files listed in `.cursorignore` or `.dadosferaignore` using non-destructive commands such as `cat` or similar tools for viewing file contents.
*   **Prohibition on Editing**: Any operation that would alter the content, metadata, or permissions of these ignored files (e.g., using editors like `vim`, `nano`, or commands like `echo` to overwrite content) is not allowed without explicit user authorization.
*   **Authorization Procedure**: If an AI agent believes a change to an ignored file is necessary, it must:
    1. Clearly state the need to edit the specific file and explain the purpose of the change.
    2. Request explicit permission from the user (e.g., "May I edit the file listed in `.cursorignore` to update a configuration?").
    3. Wait for affirmative user consent before proceeding with any modifications.
*   **Documentation**: If authorization is granted, the AI must log the authorization step, the specific changes made, and the reason for the edit in the commit history or associated task documentation.

This rule ensures that sensitive or protected files remain unchanged by AI agents unless explicitly authorized by a human user.
