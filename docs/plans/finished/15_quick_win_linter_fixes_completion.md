# Quick Win: Linter Fixes Completion Report

**Priority**: QW_30m_HIGH
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Completion Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)

## 🎯 **Quick Win Achieved**

Successfully resolved minor linter issues in `tests/unit/test_port_functions.py` as a demonstration of the attention rules in action.

## 📊 **Issues Resolved**

### ✅ **Fixed Linter Issues**
1. **SIM117**: Nested `with` statements
   - **Before**: Two nested `with` statements
   - **After**: Single `with` statement with multiple context managers
   - **Impact**: Improved code readability and linter compliance

2. **RUF100**: Unused `noqa` directive
   - **Before**: Unused `# noqa: SIM117` directive
   - **After**: Removed unused directive
   - **Impact**: Cleaner code without unnecessary suppressions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Code Changes Made**
```python
# Before: Nested with statements
with patch("main.is_port_available", return_value=False):
    with pytest.raises(RuntimeError, match="No available port found"):
        find_available_port(8000, max_attempts=2)  # noqa: SIM117

# After: Single with statement with multiple contexts
with (
    patch("main.is_port_available", return_value=False),
    pytest.raises(RuntimeError, match="No available port found")
):
    find_available_port(8000, max_attempts=2)
```
